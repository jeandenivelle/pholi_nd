# pholi_nd
This is the continuation of PHOLI after November 2025. PHOLI senior is somewehat working but needs a major revision in proof representation.

PHOLI is an attempt to implement proof checking for higher order, 3-valuedgic (PCL) with interfaces.
In the first implementation PHOLI senior, I experimented with calculi. Originally I planned to use some kind of interactive resolution calculus, and designed data structures for this. Now (Oct 2025) I understand that this is not possible, and the calculus has evolved into a natural deduction calculus. In this calculus, one can do proofs. It is a nice calculus, but unfortunately, the data structures for proofs are not suitable for representing natural deduction proofs, which makes a partial rewrite necessary if I want to move forward. 

Since PHOLI senior somewhat works and I want to keep it, I start a new project PHOLI (natural deduction). Most code comes from the previous version.
I know that one use parallel branches in github, but I want a new name as well.
